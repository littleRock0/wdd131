        <h2>History</h2>
        <p class="history">The ‚ÄúRemember the Maine‚Äù monument in Vernal, Utah is a striking painted American flag and the 
            rallying cry "Remember the Maine" emblazoned approximately 70‚Äì100 feet high on a sheer cliff face in Dry Fork Canyon. 
            The idea originated in 1898 when Utah state representative Billy Gibson commissioned local artist Leo Voight to paint 
            the tribute, paying him $50 for the work. Voight and volunteers suspended him 225 feet over the edge while he painted 
            using a mixture of lamp black and linseed oil. The nearby Remember the Maine Park offers a serene setting with picnic 
            tables, playgrounds, fire pits, and riverside access, blending historical remembrance with outdoor recreation.</p>
        <h2>Climbing</h2>
        <p class="climbing">"The area was developed in the summer of 2024 by the Dinoland Adventure Project, focused on 
            increasing the number of routes close to Vernal. There is loose rock in this recently developed area. Helmets are 
            advised for the leader and the belayer. Overall the area is climbable sandstone, but please be cautious when pulling 
            on flakes or blocks as this area is fresh, and it is likely that some holds will break with use. Mussy hooks are 
            equipped on each route, and the quickdraw requirements for each route do not include the anchors. Please don‚Äôt TR off 
            of them. Because of the nature of sandstone, it is easily damaged when wet. Don‚Äôt climb when wet or within 48-72 
            hours of a rainstorm. When parking at the crag, please park on the cliffside of the road. All routes can be climbed 
            with a 40M rope. Remember the Maine park has restrooms and overflow parking available. Crag gets hot in the morning, 
            but is shady by early afternoon." - Mountain Project</p>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p class="directions">"From Vernal, get to 500 North and head west to 3500 west. Head north and stay on the road until you arrive at Remember the Maine park. The Flag Crag is the wall across the road from the main park area. Parking is available on the cliff-side, and can accommodate a few cars" - Mountain Project</p>
